DCT.py - Image Compression GUI that uses the DCT similar to how JPEG Compression is done.

Foreground/Background Segmentation - Computes a real-time foreground/background map on a video feed by adaptively processing each frame. Works best with low resolution videos (better processing time) and a fixed camera.

Voice Detection App - Detects frequency (Hz) of speakers based on a 3 stage voice recognition pipeline. 

KCF Tracking App - Video Processing App that uses Foreground/Background Segmentation along with KCF Object Tracking to detect the speed of foreground objects in a camera view in real-time.
